# QuickerSite
CMS for Windows Servers
Install this application in the root of an IIS website and make sure IUSR has full permissions on the entire folder.
Make sure "default.asp" is the default document. 
When browsing to your site the first time, you will be prompted with a password, by default this is "admin". You have to change that to something else.
